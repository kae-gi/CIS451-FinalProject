<h3> Summary </h3>
<p>
  The topic of interest is designing a basic model of a hospital management system.
  There are the included tables: patient, room, hospital, employee, scheduled hours,
  diagnosis results, bills, and tables describing nurse shifts and doctor shifts.
  More specific details about table attributes can be found in the Physical Design/Table Contents section.
  One such example would be a patient, who has describing attributes such as name, age, sex,
  and status, but who is also connected to where they are staying, how much they will be paying,
  as well as their diagnosis and who cared for them.
<br>
<br>
  Applications included in this model are: <br>
  1a) calculating patient bill total <br>
  1b) what makes up that bill <br>
  2) given a hospital, show where patients are located <br>
  3) given a hospital, show when and where a nurse employee works and for how many hours for a single week <br>
  4) given a hospital, show when and where a doctor employee works and for how many hours for a single week <br>
  5) given a patient, show what their diagnosis is, status is, what hospital they are located, and what doctor diagnosed them

This is very easy to use. Simply click on an application below, and the page will prompt you to
select a patient or hospital depending on application chosen. Hit submit and the query will
work.

<h3> Conclusion </h3>
<p>
If given more time, I would have liked to include more information in my tables,
as well as gone more complex in my applications. More applications could have been
included as well. Adding further customizability into the input for the applications
would have been desirable. Improving the design of the pages in terms of aesthetics
and functionality would have been a nice improvement.
